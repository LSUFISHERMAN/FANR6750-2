# labs

**Meet weekly**

--

- You should have registered for one and only one lab section

--

- Always attend your assigned lab section unless both TA's have provided prior approval to attend the other section

--

**Taught in R**

--

- No prior experience required

--

- But those without prior experience may need to spend time learning outside of class

--

- You can use your own laptop but make sure you have R and RStudio installed prior the first lab<sup>1</sup>

# lab assignments

--

- 10 throughout semester 

--

- Meant to help with:
    + Understanding lecture/lab concepts
    + Implementing models in R
    + Interpreting and presenting results
    
--

- Worth 10 points each
    + 6 points for turning in **complete** assignment **on time**
    + 4 points for correctness  

---
# grading

#### 250 points total

--

- 3 lecture exams, 50 points (20%) each

    + Take-home, open-note format
    + Not (explicitly) cummulative<sup>1</sup>
    + See schedule for approximate dates (subject to change)

--

- 10 lab assignments, 10 points (4%) each

.footnote[[1] Material is somewhat cumulative by nature & some important concepts will be repeated]

# a note on AI

#### AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) have advanced very rapidly in a very short time  

--
- AI can increasingly help answer questions about statistical concepts, coding, etc.  

--

#### AI = resource (similar to Google, Cross Validated, etc.)  

- AI can help you perform statistical analyses but **it cannot replace your own statistical knowledge**  

--

#### My goal is not to fight AI, but instead to incorporate it into exams and assignments  

- Learn to properly and ethically use AI, including when to be skeptical  

- This will be a learning experience for all of us

# course objectives

**To understand:**  
<br/>

--
1) the logical structure of experiments, especially the design of manipulative experiments;  
<br/>

--
2) the analysis of such experiments, focusing on linear models;  
<br/>

--
3) the use of models in ecological studies (experimental and observational);  
<br/>


---
# basic structure

--

1) Foundational concepts for statistical inference

--

2) Linear model basics

--

3) Null hypothesis significance testing

--

4) Linear model variations for experiments (t-tests, ANOVA, ANCOVA)

--

5) Generalized linear models and model selection

---
# looking ahead

### Next time: Basic Concepts in Statistics

### Reading: Quinn chp. 1
