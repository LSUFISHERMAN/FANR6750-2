# motivation

<br/>

#### Suppose we want to test the effect of diet on the early growth of chicks   

<br/>

--

#### We assign each of 36 chicks to one of four diet treatments  

<br/>

--

#### How should we measure the response of each chick to the treatment?

---
# chick data

```{r}
data("chickdata")
chickdata$Chick <- factor(chickdata$Chick)
chickdata$Diet <- factor(chickdata$Diet)
chickdata_wide <- tidyr::pivot_wider(chickdata, names_from = Time,
                                     names_prefix = "Time", values_from = weight)
# ChickWeight_wide <- dplyr::mutate(ChickWeight_wide, 
#                                 Diet = dplyr::case_when(Diet == "L" ~ "Low",
#                                                               fertilizer == "H" ~ "High"))
chickdata_wide[c(1,2,10, 11 ,19, 20, 28, 29),] %>%
  kable(format = "html", col.names = c("Chick", "Diet", "Day 0", "Day 2", "Day 4", "Day 6", "Day 8", "Day 10", "Day 12", "Day 14", "Day 16", "Day 18")) %>%

#### What are the experimental units? How do we handle time?

---
# repeated measures designs

### General features  

- Whole units are called subjects  


--

- One or more treatments is applied to each subject  


--

- The response variable is measured multiple times on each subject  


--

- Time can be thought of as a treatment variable applied at the subunit level, but it *can't be randomly assigned*  


--

- We are often most interested in the interaction between treatment and time  


--

- In some cases, one of the treatment variables might be applied part way through the experiment. A BACI design is one example  


---
# examples of repeated measures designs

#### To investigate the effect of three drugs, each drug is administered to 8 people, and each person's heart rate is measured every 5 minutes for 4 time intervals  


#### The effects of predator exclosures are assessed by monitoring prey abundance over multiple years in exclosures and control sites  


#### The effect of dam removal is evaluated by measuring upstream fish abundance before and after dam removal at multiple rivers  

---
# options for analysis

#### At least three ways to analyze data from repeated measures designs  

1) Split-plot model with adjusted p-values  

2) Profile analysis

3) Linear mixed-effects model (LMM) with serial correlation

# model

$$\Large y_{ijk} = \mu + \alpha_i + \beta_j + \alpha \beta_{ij} + \delta_{ik} + \epsilon_{ijk}$$

--

$$i = 1, ..., a \;(treatment \;levels)$$
$$j = 1, ..., b \;(time \; periods)$$
$$k = 1, ..., c \;(subjects \;per \;treatment \;level)$$
--

- $\mu =$ grand mean  

- $\alpha_i =$ effect of the $i$th treatment level  

- $\beta_{j} =$ effect of the $j$th level of time  

- $\alpha \beta_{ij} =$ interaction effect between treatment and time  

- $\delta_{ik} =$ subject effect  

- $\epsilon_{ijk} =$ residual, unexplained variation

---
# model

$$\Large y_{ijk} = \mu + \alpha_i + \beta_j + \alpha \beta_{ij} + \delta_{ik} + \epsilon_{ijk}$$

<br/>

Because we want our inferences to apply to all subjects, $\delta_{ik}$ is random:  

$$\large \delta_{ik} \sim normal(0, \sigma^2_D)$$
--

If residuals are uncorrelated, we assume:

$$\large \epsilon_{ijk} \sim normal(0, \sigma^2)$$

<br/>

--

**Note**: Hypothesis tests are analogous to those in the split-plot design

# anova table


```{r}
tab <- data.frame(col1 = c("Treatment", "Error (among-subjects)", "Time", 
                           "Interaction", "Error (within-subjects)"),
                  df = c("\\(a-1\\)", "\\(N-a\\)", "\\(b-1\\)", "\\((a-1)(b-1)\\)", "\\((N-a)(b-1)\\)"),
                  SS = c('\\(SS_a\\)', '\\(SS_{subject}\\)', '\\(SS_{Time}\\)', 
                         '\\(SS_{a \\times time}\\)', '\\(SS_e\\)'),
                  MS = c('\\(SS_a/(a-1)\\)', '\\(SS_{subject}/(N-a)\\)', '\\(SS_{Time}/(b-1)\\)', 
                         '\\(SS_{a \\times time}/(a-1)(b-1)\\)', '\\(SS_e/(N-a)(b-1)\\)'),
                  F = c('\\(MS_{a}/MS_{subject}\\)', NA, '\\(MS_{Time}/MS_{e}\\)', '\\(MS_{a \\times time}/MS_{e}\\)', NA))

options(knitr.kable.NA = " ")

tab %>%
  kable(format = "html", align = c("r", "c", "c", "c", "c", "c", "c"),
        col.names = c("Source", "df", "SS", "MS", "F"))%>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 14)
```

--

Note that these formulas assume *balanced* data (same number of subjects per treatment and measurements per subject)

--

Also, if residuals *are* correlated (which we expect them to be. Why?), *p*-values will be wrong (too low)

                  SS = c(31811, 125635, 931818, 24189, 130911),

Which effect in the above table are we primarily interested in?

--

But remember, if residuals *are* correlated, *p*-values will be wrong (too low)  

---
# adjusting *p* -values

If we use a split-plot type of ANOVA, we can deal with correlated residuals by adjusting the *p*-values  

--

The two common adjustment methods are called the **Greenhouse-Geisser** and the **Huynh-Feldt** methods. Estimate $\hat{\epsilon}$, the degree to which assumption of "*sphericity*" is violated ( $\hat{\epsilon}<1$ indicate assumption violated)  

  - Sphericity is equivalent to equal variances but applied to variances of the *differences* ( $\sigma^2_{1-2} = \sigma^2_{1-3} = \sigma^2_{2-3}$...)  

  - In general, $\hat{\epsilon}_{H-F} > \hat{\epsilon}_{G-G}$
  
--

The adjustments involve modifying the degrees-of-freedom of the *F* tests of the among-subjects factors (treatment and among-subject error)  

- $df_{adj} = (a - 1) \hat{\epsilon}$, $(a - 1)(N - 1)\hat{\epsilon}$

--

Adjustments only make the *p*-values go up, so there is no need to bother with them if your tests aren't significant under the independence assumption  

--

We will explore this further in lab

---
# problems with split-plot analysis

The split-plot ANOVA approach is relatively simple to perform in `R` and is a natural extension of concepts we have already learned. However:

--

- results are not robust in the presence of severely unbalanced data

--

- *p*-value adjustments apply to the main treatment, not to time or time $\times$ treatment interaction

--

- difficult to accomodate additional model structure (blocks, multiple random effects, etc.)

# profile analysis

---
# profile analysis

Profile analysis is typically used to test the effects of time or the time-treatment interaction in repeated measures studies. A common application is in growth studies  

--

If we plot the *rate of change* between measurements, we can think of several possible outcomes:

--

- If the interaction is significant, the growth curves for each treatment will not be parallel  

--

- If the interaction is not significant, but the time effect is, then the curves will be parallel but not flat  

--

- If neither time nor the interaction is significant, the curves will be flat   

--

These possibilities can be explored using a profile analysis.

# model

Profile analysis is based on multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA)

--

$$\LARGE \Delta y_{i} \sim MVN(\mu_i, \Sigma)$$

--

where

- $\large \Delta y_i$ is a vector with the differences in the response variable between consecutive measurements for subject *i* (e.g., $y_1 - y_0$, $y_2 - y_1$, etc.)  

- $\large \mu_i$ is the vector of expected values for subject *i* (determined by the fixed time and treatment effects and the subject-specific random effects)  

- $\large \Sigma$ is the variance-covariance matrix of the multivariate normal distribution. It has *T* rows and *T* columns, where *T* is the number of time periods  

--

If the multivariate test is significant, univariate ANOVAs $-$ one for each time period $-$ can be used to determine when the treatment had significant effects  

--

We will  explore this in more detail in lab

# linear mixed models

---
# linear mixed models

Increasingly, linear mixed models that account for autocorrelation are the preferred method to fit repeated measures data

--

Linear mixed models have several advantages over the split-plot ANOVA or profile analysis methods:

--

- Highly flexible (e.g., can include additional random effects and interactions)

--

- Can handle unbalanced designs

--

- the `nlme` package provides methods for accounted for serial autocorrelation common in repeated measures data

# summary

<br/>

#### Which of the three methods should I use?  

--

- It's up to you!  

--

- The simplest approach might be the split-plot option with adjusted p-values  

--

- The most robust approach might be the MANOVA  

--

- Another alternative approach, linear mixed models with serial correlation, is 
flexible enough to handle many different designs and data characteristics preference
